# Home Assistant

## MQTT discovery
The easiest way to integrate Zigbee2MQTT with Home Assistant is by
using [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).
This allows Zigbee2MQTT to automatically add devices to Home Assistant.

To achieve the best possible integration (including MQTT discovery):
- In your **Zigbee2MQTT** `configuration.yaml` set `homeassistant: true`
- Enable the [MQTT integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) in Home Assistant

## Device/group page
Since Home Assistant 2021.11 the device/group page in Home Assistant can directly link to the frontend (*Visit device* button).
To enable this set the `url` in the [frontend](../../configuration/frontend.md) configuration.

## Home Assistant device registry
When using Home Assistant MQTT discovery, Zigbee2MQTT integrates
with the [Home Assistant device registry](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/device_registry_index.html).
This allows you to change the Home Assistant `entity_id` and `friendly_name` from the Home Assistant web interface
without having to restart Home Assistant. It also makes it possible to show which entities belong to which device.

## Customizing discovery
The device specific configuration allows you to modify the discovery payload. Here you can also prevent a device from being discovered. See [Device specific configuration](../../configuration/) for the available options.

## Responding to button clicks
To respond to button clicks (e.g. WXKG01LM) you can use one of the following three Home Assistant configurations.

### Via MQTT device trigger (recommended)
[MQTT device trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_trigger.mqtt/) is the recommended way to respond to button clicks.
The MQTT device triggers are discovered by Zigbee2MQTT **once the event is triggered on the device at least once**.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button click
    trigger:
    - device_id: ad44cabee4c646f493814306aa6446e1
      discovery_id: 0x000b57fffecb472d action_arrow_left_click
      domain: mqtt
      platform: device
      subtype: arrow_left_click
      type: action
    action:
      entity_id: light.my_bulb_light
      service: light.toggle
```

If you only plan to use this and want to disable the *Via Home Assistant entity* integration below, set `homeassistant: {legacy_triggers: false}` (see [Configuration](../../configuration/homeassistant.md) for more info).

### Via Home Assistant entity
This method work by responding to the state change event of a sensor.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button click
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.my_switch_click
      to: 'single'
    action:
      entity_id: light.my_bulb_light
      service: light.toggle
```

### Via MQTT
As an alternative to the above way of integrating, you can also listen to MQTT topics.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Respond to button clicks
    trigger:
      platform: mqtt
      topic: 'zigbee2mqtt/<FRIENDLY_NAME'
    condition:
      condition: template
      value_template: '{{ "single" == trigger.payload_json.click }}'
    action:
      entity_id: light.bedroom
      service: light.toggle
```

## Groups
Groups discovery is supported for groups of lights, switches, locks and covers. For other types you have to manually create a config in the Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`.

## Exposing switch as a light
If your device is currently discovered as a switch and you want to discover it as a light, the following config in the Zigbee2MQTT `configuration.yaml` can be used:

```yaml
devices:
  "0x12345678":
    friendly_name: my_switch
    homeassistant:
      switch:
        type: light
        object_id: light
      light:
        name: my_switch
        value_template: null
        state_value_template: '{{ value_json.state }}'
      # OR if your devices has multiple endpoints (e.g. left/right)
      switch_left:
        type: light
        object_id: light_left
      light_left:
        name: my_switch_left
        value_template: null
        state_value_template: '{{ value_json.state_left }}'
      switch_right:
        type: light
        object_id: light_right
      light_right:
        name: my_switch_right
        value_template: null
        state_value_template: '{{ value_json.state_right }}'
```

If you are also using device specific overrides, make sure that they are configured under the new device type rather than the original device type.

## Using a custom name for the device and entities
In order to get a more readable name for the device and entities in Home Assistant, a specific name for Home Assistant can be set in the device configuration. If set, this name will be used instead of `friendly_name`.

```yaml
devices:
  "0x12345678":
    friendly_name: living_room/temperature_sensor
    homeassistant:
      name: Living Room Temperature Sensor
```

## Controlling Zigbee2MQTT via Home Assistant
The following Home Assistant configuration allows you to control Zigbee2MQTT from Home Assistant.

You can add it to the appropriate section of your `configuration.yaml`, or you can add it as a [Home Assistant Package](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/) by adding the following to `zigbee2mqtt.yaml` in your packages folder.

```yaml
