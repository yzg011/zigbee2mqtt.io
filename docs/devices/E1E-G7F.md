### Pairing
Factory reset the switch by pressing and holding the on and off buttons at the same time for at least 3 seconds. The indicator will start flashing, indicating a successful reset. The device will enter pairing mode for one minute. If the device is not connected in one minute, you must restart the pairing process.

If device won't go in to pairing mode, try installing a fresh battery.

### Long press action
The device will sometimes output a single push in addition to a long press. You can mitigate this by using the Debounce device configuration. Refer to *[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*.
