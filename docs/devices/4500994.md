## Exposes

### State (binary)
On/off state of the switch.
Value can be found in the published state on the `state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` state is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `child_lock` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": "LOCK"}` or `{"child_lock": "UNLOCK"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `window_detection` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"window_detection": "ON"}`, `{"window_detection": "OFF"}` or `{"window_detection": "TOGGLE"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `away_mode` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"away_mode": "ON"}`, `{"away_mode": "OFF"}` or `{"away_mode": "undefined"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `system_mode`, `running_state`, `sensor`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the 째C between `5` and `35`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in 째C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `heat`, `auto`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"running_state": ""}`.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to be used in the local_temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`

### External_temperature (numeric)
Current temperature measured on the external sensor (floor).
Value can be found in the published state on the `external_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Hysteresis (numeric)
The difference between the temperature at which the thermostat switches off, and the temperature at which it switches on again..
Value can be found in the published state on the `hysteresis` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"hysteresis": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`.

### Max_temperature_protection (numeric)
Max guarding temperature.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_temperature_protection` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_temperature_protection": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `20` and the maximum value is `95`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
