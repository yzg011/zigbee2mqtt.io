## Notes


### Pairing
Press the reset button for about 5 seconds. The LED lights up 3 times.
Then press the button again every 2 seconds (maximum 20 times).

*NOTE: When you fail to pair a device, try replacing the battery, this could solve the problem.*

### Meaning of `strength` value
The `strength` value, which is reported every 300 seconds after vibration is detected, is the max strength measured during a period of 300 second.


### Troubleshooting: device stops sending messages/disconnects from network
Since Xiaomi devices do not fully comply to the Zigbee standard, it sometimes happens that they disconnect from the network.
Most of the times this happens because of the following reasons:
- Device has a weak signal, you can see the signal quality in the published messages as `linkquality`. A linkquality < 20 is considered weak.
- Low battery voltage, this can even happen when the battery still appears full. Try a different battery.
- The device is connected through a router which cannot deal with Xiaomi devices. This is known to happen devices from: Centralite, General Electric, Iris, Ledvance, Legrand, OSRAM, Sylvania, SmartThings, Securifi. A possible solution is to connect the device directly to the central coordinator by pushing the reset button while being physically close to it.

More detailed information about this can be found [here](https://community.hubitat.com/t/xiaomi-aqara-devices-pairing-keeping-them-connected/623).


### Sensitivity
The sensitivity can be changed by publishing to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`
`{"sensitivity": "SENSITIVITY"}` where `SENSITIVITY` is one of the following
values: `low`, `medium`,  `high`.

After setting the sensitivity you immediately have to start pressing the reset button with an interval of 1 second until you see Zigbee2MQTT publishing the new sensitivity to MQTT.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `device_temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for device_temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `device_temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the device_temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `vibration_timeout`: Time in seconds after which vibration is cleared after detecting it (default 90 seconds). The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0`


## Exposes
