## Notes


### Pairing
Pair the remote to Zigbee2MQTT by holding it close to the coordinator and
pressing the inside button, next to the CR2032 battery, 4 times.
The red light on the (front of the) remote will now flash a few times.

### Troubleshooting: no battery level
It may help to remove the battery for a few seconds and after that reconfigure it via [Configure](../guide/usage/mqtt_topics_and_messages.md#zigbee2mqttbridgeconfigure). Right before executing the Configure make sure to wake up the device by pressing a button on it.

### Troubleshooting: Device didn't respond to OTA request
To resolve the `Device didn't respond to OTA request` error, you can try to push a button on it, shortly before you start the update, to wake up the Remote.

### Binding
The [binding](../guide/usage/binding.md) functionallity of this remote varies per firmware version:
- < 2.3.014: binding is not supported, OTA update your device to get binding functionallity
- 2.3.014 - 2.3.074: suppports binding to groups only. It can only be bound to 1 group at a time. By default this remote is bound to the default bind group which you first have to unbind it from. This can be done by sending to `zigbee2mqtt/bridge/request/device/unbind` payload `{"from": "DEVICE_FRIENDLY_NAME", "to": "default_bind_group"}`. Wake up the device right before sending the commands by pressing a button on it.
- 2.3.075 and greater : supports binding to devices only

**Note:** Prior to sending a 'bind' command using an MQTT message directly or through the frontend, push a button on the remote to wake it up. Otherwise, the remote will not be in a receiving state and the bind will fail with a general 'error'.

Once bound to a group/bulb you will notice that the toggle and brightness buttons will work, but scenes/color temperature most likely won't work. This appears to be a missing piece of functionality ([discussion](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/1232)), but via a workaround this can be managed;
1. Create a group with ID **65289** (name it ie. Trafri_scenes) and add the device(s) you control with the remote.
2. Add/store [scenes](../guide/usage/scenes.md) for the created group
3. Once you click left/right on the remote, the scenes will be called sequentially (should there be a device off sync in scenes, hold the toggle button for 3 sec.).

### Toggle button
When clicking the middle (center) button on the remote it will send a `{"click": "toggle"}`, when holding it
it will **also** send a `{"click": "toggle_hold"}`. It is not possible to skip the `toggle` when the button is hold.
Also the remote won't send anything when the button is released.
See [link](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/2077#issuecomment-538691885) for more details.
