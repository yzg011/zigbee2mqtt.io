## Exposes

### Carbon_monoxide (binary)
Indicates if CO (carbon monoxide) is detected.

If value equals `true` carbon_monoxide is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Co (numeric)
The measured CO (carbon monoxide) value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `co` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `ppm`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
