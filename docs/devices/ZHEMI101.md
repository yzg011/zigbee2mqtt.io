Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Pulse_configuration (numeric)
Pulses per kwh. Default 1000 imp/kWh. Range 0 to 65535.
Value can be found in the published state on the `pulse_configuration` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"pulse_configuration": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"pulse_configuration": NEW_VALUE}`.

The possible values are: `electricity`, `gas`, `water`, `kamstrup-kmp`, `linky`, `IEC62056-21`, `DSMR-2.3`, `DSMR-4.0`.

### Current_summation (numeric)
Current summation value sent to the display. e.g. 570 = 0,570 kWh.
Value will **not** be published in the state.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_summation": NEW_VALUE}`.
