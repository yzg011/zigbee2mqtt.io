## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset by removing the plastic cover and press & hold the power button for 10 seconds. The LED is then
starting to blink Red/Blue to indicate in pairing mode.

### Should automatically support (only tested Kamstrup)
- Aidon
- Kaifa
- Kamstrup

### Configuring interface mode
There should be no need to configure into any interface mode as the Eva HAN should autodetect the correct mode.

### Not getting measurements
In case you are not getting any measurements, it could be that your firmware is too old. If firmware are < 0.4
either update fw via Eva Smart HUB or ask Datek for a replacement with min fw 0.4. Tested on 0.4.

## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `power_calibration`: Calibrates the power value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `current_calibration`: Calibrates the current value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `voltage_calibration`: Calibrates the voltage value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.
