## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

## Exposes

### Moving (enum, left endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `moving_left` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `UP`, `STOP`, `DOWN`.

### Moving (enum, right endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `moving_right` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `UP`, `STOP`, `DOWN`.

### Calibration_time (numeric)
Calibration time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `S`.

### Cover (left endpoint)
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state_left` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_left": "OPEN"}`, `{"state_left": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state_left": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position_left": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Calibration (binary, left endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_left` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"calibration_left": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"calibration_left": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` calibration is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Motor_reversal (binary, left endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `motor_reversal_left` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"motor_reversal_left": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motor_reversal_left": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` motor_reversal is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Cover (right endpoint)
The current state of this cover is in the published state under the `state_right` property (value is `OPEN` or `CLOSE`).
To control this cover publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state_right": "OPEN"}`, `{"state_right": "CLOSE"}`, `{"state_right": "STOP"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To change the position publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"position_right": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is a number between `0` and `100`.

### Calibration (binary, right endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_right` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"calibration_right": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"calibration_right": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` calibration is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Motor_reversal (binary, right endpoint)
Value can be found in the published state on the `motor_reversal_right` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"motor_reversal_right": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motor_reversal_right": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` motor_reversal is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
