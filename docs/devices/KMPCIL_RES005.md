## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `temperature_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for temperature, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `temperature_calibration`: Calibrates the temperature value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `humidity_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for humidity, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `humidity_calibration`: Calibrates the humidity value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `pressure_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for pressure, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `pressure_calibration`: Calibrates the pressure value (absolute offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `illuminance_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for illuminance, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `illuminance_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.

* `illuminance_lux_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for illuminance_lux, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `illuminance_lux_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance_lux value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Temperature (numeric)
Measured temperature value.
Value can be found in the published state on the `temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `Â°C`.

### Humidity (numeric)
Measured relative humidity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `humidity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Pressure (numeric)
The measured atmospheric pressure.
Value can be found in the published state on the `pressure` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `hPa`.

### Illuminance (numeric)
Raw measured illuminance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.

### Illuminance_lux (numeric)
Measured illuminance in lux.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_lux` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Occupancy (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected occupancy.
Value can be found in the published state on the `occupancy` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` occupancy is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `state` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
To control this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"state": "ON"}`, `{"state": "OFF"}` or `{"state": "TOGGLE"}`.
To read the current state of this switch publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"state": ""}`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
