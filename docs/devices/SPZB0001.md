## Notes

### Pairing
If you are having trouble pairing, reset the device.
- Make sure the device is on auto or heat mode (not off). Hold boost, +, and - (a count from 1 to 10 will be on the display, it may be required for the thermostat to be dismounted from the radiator valve for this to work)
- release once 'rES' is displayed
- hit boost once after 'Jin' is displayed to start pairing to the ZigBee network
- once successfully paired 'Ins' should be displayed and the boost button should flash green. Make sure the thermostat is mounted on the radiator valve before pressing the boost button again.
- now the display should read 'Ada' indicating the adapting process is started which should mechanically calibrate the thermostat to the valve.

### Recommendation
This device sends multiple messages in short time period with the same payload. It’s worth setting debounce option to throttle them without losing unique action payloads.

E.g. (devices.yaml)


```yaml
'0xabc457fffe679xyz':
    friendly_name: my_device
    debounce: 0.5
```

### Controlling
*Current heating setpoint*
```json
{
    "current_heating_setpoint": 21.5
}
```
Current heating setpoint is also modified when occupied or unoccupied heating setpoint is set.

*System mode*

The system mode will be either `off`, `auto`, or `heat`. When set to `heat` the boost host flags will be set, when using `off` the window_open host flag will be set (and off will be displayed on the display).

*Eurotronic host flags*

The `eurotronic_host_flags` property contains an object with a true/false field for each host option.

```json
{
  "eurotronic_host_flags": {
    "mirror_display": false,
    "boost": false,
    "window_open": false,
    "child_protection": true
  }
}
```

You can toggle these flags by publishing a message to the `set` MQTT topic containing `eurotronic_host_flags`. e.g. enabling the display mirroring:
```json
{"eurotronic_host_flags": {"mirror_display": true}}
```

**Note that `true` or `false` do not have quotes aroud them!**

*Eurotronic system mode*

**This is deprecated in favor of eurotronic_host_flags, but will still work for now.**

This is a bitmap encoded field to set several device specific features. Please remind it is not possible to set single bits, always the full bitmap is written. Bit 0 doesn't seem to be writeable, it is always reported as set, so expect your written value + 1 to be reported.

Bit | Position
--- | --------
0 | unknown (default 1)
1 | Mirror display
2 | Boost
3 | unknown
4 | disable window open
5 | set window open (is reported as disable window open)
6 | unknown
7 | Child protection

Examples for eurotronic_system_mode:

Mirror display, reported as 3
```json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 2
}
```
signal external window open, current_heating_setpoint will report "5", device display shows "OFF"
```json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 32
}
```
signal external window close, will restore last current_heating_setpoint value
```json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 16
}
```
Mirror display and set child protection.
```json
{
    "eurotronic_system_mode": 66
}
```

*Eurotronic error status*
```json
{
    "eurotronic_error_status": 0
}
```
This field is a readonly bitmap

Bit | Position
--- | --------
0 | reserved
1 | reserved
2 | reserved
3 | Valve adaption failed (E1)
4 | Valve movement too slow (E2)
5 | Valve not moving/blocked (E3)
6 | reserved
7 | reserved

## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `thermostat_unit`: Controls the temperature unit of the thermostat (default celsius). The value must be one of `celsius`, `fahrenheit`

* `legacy`: Set to false to disable the legacy integration (highly recommended), will change structure of the published payload (default true). The value must be `true` or `false`


## Exposes

### Battery (numeric)
Remaining battery in %.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `100`.
The unit of this value is `%`.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `occupied_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `system_mode`, `running_state`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `pi_heating_demand`.
- `occupied_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `30`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"occupied_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in °C). To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `auto`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"running_state": ""}`.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to be used in the local_temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"local_temperature": ""}`.

### Trv_mode (enum)
Select between direct control of the valve via the `valve_position` or automatic control of the valve based on the `current_heating_setpoint`. For manual control set the value to 1, for automatic control set the value to 2 (the default). When switched to manual mode the display shows a value from 0 (valve closed) to 100 (valve fully open) and the buttons on the device are disabled..
Value can be found in the published state on the `trv_mode` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"trv_mode": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"trv_mode": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `1`, `2`.

### Valve_position (numeric)
Directly control the radiator valve when `trv_mode` is set to 1. The values range from 0 (valve closed) to 255 (valve fully open).
Value can be found in the published state on the `valve_position` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"valve_position": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"valve_position": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.

Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
