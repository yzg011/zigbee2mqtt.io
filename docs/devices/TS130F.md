To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"calibration": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"calibration": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` calibration is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Motor_reversal (binary)
Value can be found in the published state on the `motor_reversal` property.
To read (`/get`) the value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"motor_reversal": ""}`.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motor_reversal": NEW_VALUE}`.
If value equals `ON` motor_reversal is ON, if `OFF` OFF.

### Backlight_mode (enum)

The possible values are: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`.

### Calibration_time (numeric)
Calibration time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `calibration_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
