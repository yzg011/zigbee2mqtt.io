## Notes


### Pairing
Switch the thermostat off. Press and hold the temperature down button for +- 8 seconds to enable the pairing mode (display lights up and a WiFi-like icon is blinking). After successful interview turn the thermostat on again.

### Stop message flooding
This unit has a bug that makes it send multiple messages when updating. To stop this from flooding your MQTT Queues, please add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:


devices:
  '0x12345678':
    friendly_name: thermostat
    debounce: 1

## Exposes

### Lock 
The current state of this lock is in the published state under the `child_lock` property (value is `LOCK` or `UNLOCK`).
To control this lock publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"child_lock": "LOCK"}` or `{"child_lock": "UNLOCK"}`.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Deadzone_temperature (numeric)
The delta between local_temperature and current_heating_setpoint to trigger Heat.
Value can be found in the published state on the `deadzone_temperature` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"deadzone_temperature": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `5`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Max_temperature_limit (numeric)
Maximum temperature limit.
Value can be found in the published state on the `max_temperature_limit` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"max_temperature_limit": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `35`.
The unit of this value is `째C`.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `current_heating_setpoint`, `local_temperature`, `local_temperature_calibration`, `system_mode`, `running_state`, `preset`, `sensor`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the 째C between `5` and `30`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": ""}`.
- `local_temperature`: Current temperature measured on the device (in 째C). Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
- `system_mode`: Mode of this device. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"system_mode": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `off`, `heat`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"system_mode": ""}`.
- `preset`: Mode of this device (similar to system_mode). To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"preset": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is one of: `hold`, `program`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"preset": ""}`.
- `running_state`: The current running state. Possible values are: `idle`, `heat`, `cool`. To read send a message to `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/get` with payload `{"running_state": ""}`.
- `local_temperature_calibration`: Offset to be used in the local_temperature. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"local_temperature_calibration": VALUE}.`

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
