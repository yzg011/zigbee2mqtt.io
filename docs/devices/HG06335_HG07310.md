## Notes


### Pairing
Factory reset the motion detector by holding the reset button (little hole on the right side, **not the button on the back**) for 5 seconds.
When you let go of the button an LED should blink.
After resetting the motion detector will automatically connect.
While pairing, keep the motion detector close to the adapter.
Press the tamper button a few times while pairing to keep the sensor a wake.

### Tamper
If the button on the back is pressed (i.e. the device is on the mounting plate), the value of `tamper` equals `false` otherwise it is `true`.
