### Pairing

While pairing, keep the valve close to the coordinator.

1. *Turn the display on*: Short press home (🏠).
2. *Enter settings*: Long press home (🏠) for 3sec.
3. *Select WiFi settings*: Press the plus button (➕) button 4 times to see the digital **`5`** on the right hand side and the blinking WiFi logo.
4. *Enter WiFi settings*: Press home (🏠) once again. Now only WiFi logo is showing without blinking.
5. *Enable pairing mode*: Long press home (🏠). WiFi logo is now blinking.
6. *Keep display on*: Touch home (🏠) every few seconds.

### Local temperature
If you'd like to force device to send local_temperature you can use this MQTT command:
* `topic`: zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set/local_temperature_calibration
* `payload`: YOUR_CURRENT_CALIBRATION_VALUE

YOUR_CURRENT_CALIBRATION_VALUE can be 0, but if you calibrated temperature for this device send current value.
After this command thermostat responds with two messages. One for calibration change confirmation, and other with current local_temperature.

### Controlling device specific features

- If all you need is to control on and off, you can set "force" with topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`. The payload values are:
  open -> fully opens valve and stays there
  close -> fully closes valve and stays there
  normal -> normal valve operation

    ```json
    {
        "force": "open"
    }
    ```

- Use topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set/schedule` to set the schedule of the device with 6 timeslots on workdays or holidays (e.g. weekend). Example payload values are:

    ```json
    {
        "workdays":[
            {"hour":6,"minute":0,"temperature":19},
            {"hour":8,"minute":0,"temperature":20},
            {"hour":18,"minute":0,"temperature":21},
            {"hour":20,"minute":30,"temperature":20},
            {"hour":22,"minute":0,"temperature":19},
            {"hour":23,"minute":30,"temperature":15}
        ]
    }
    ```

    ```json
    {
        "holidays":[
            {"hour":6,"minute":0,"temperature":19},
            {"hour":8,"minute":0,"temperature":20},
            {"hour":18,"minute":0,"temperature":21},
            {"hour":20,"minute":30,"temperature":20},
            {"hour":22,"minute":0,"temperature":19},
            {"hour":23,"minute":30,"temperature":15}
        ]
    }
    ```
- You can set "week" schedule pattern with topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`. The payload values are:
  5+2 -> to be used when workdays for example are monday-friday and saturday & sunday are holidays
  6+1 -> to be used when workdays for example are monday-saturday and sunday is a holiday
  7 -> to be used when workdays schedule will be used for the whole week

    ```json
    {
        "week": "5+2"
    }
    ```

- You can set "boost time" with topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`. But be aware that it rounds the values down to multiple of 100.

    ```json
    {
        "boost_time": 200
    }
    ```
- You can set "comfort temperature" level on the device with topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`.

    ```json
    {
        "comfort_temperature": 21
    }
    ```
- You can set "eco temperature" level on the device with topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set`.

    ```json
    {
        "eco_temperature": 17
    }
    ```

### Window_open (binary)
Window open?.
Value can be found in the published state on the `window_open` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `undefined` window_open is ON, if `undefined` OFF.

### Battery_low (binary)
Indicates if the battery of this device is almost empty.
Value can be found in the published state on the `battery_low` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` battery_low is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Switch 
The current state of this switch is in the published state under the `valve_detection` property (value is `ON` or `OFF`).
