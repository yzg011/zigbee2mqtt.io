It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"o_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `sensitive`, `normal`, `cautious`.

### V_sensitivity (enum)
V-Sensitivity mode.
Value can be found in the published state on the `v_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"v_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `speed_priority`, `normal_priority`, `accuracy_priority`.

### Led_status (enum)
Led status switch.
Value can be found in the published state on the `led_status` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"led_status": NEW_VALUE}`.
The possible values are: `ON`, `OFF`.

### Vacancy_delay (numeric)
Vacancy delay.
Value can be found in the published state on the `vacancy_delay` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"vacancy_delay": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `1000`.
The unit of this value is `sec`.

### Light_on_luminance_prefer (numeric)
Light-On luminance prefer.
Value can be found in the published state on the `light_on_luminance_prefer` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
