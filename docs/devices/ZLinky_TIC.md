## OTA updates
This device supports OTA updates, for more information see [OTA updates](../guide/usage/ota_updates.md).


## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `measurement_poll_interval`: This device does not support reporting electric measurements so it is polled instead. The default poll interval is 60 seconds, set to -1 to disable. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `-1`

* `linky_mode`: Counter with TIC in mode standard or historique. May require restart (default: auto). The value must be one of `auto`, `historique`, `standard`

* `energy_phase`: Power with single or three phase. May require restart (default: auto). The value must be one of `auto`, `single_phase`, `three_phase`

* `production`: If you produce energy back to the grid (works ONLY when linky_mode: standard, default: auto). The value must be one of `auto`, `true`, `false`

* `tarif`: Overrides the automatic current tarif. This option will exclude unnecesary attributes. Open a issue to support more of them. Default: auto. The value must be one of `Historique - BASE`, `Historique - HCHP`, `Historique - EJP`, `Historique - BBR`, `Standard - Sem WE Mercredi`, `Standard - BASE`, `Standard - Heure Pleine Heure Creuse`, `auto`

* `kWh_precision`: Number of digits after decimal point for kWh, takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `0` and with a with a maximum value of `3`

* `measurement_poll_chunk`: During the poll, request multiple exposes to the Zlinky at once for reducing Zigbee network overload. Too much request at once could exceed device limit. Requieres Z2M restart. Default: 1. The value must be a number with a minimum value of `1`

* `tic_command_whitelist`: List of TIC commands to be exposed (separated by comma). Reconfigure device after change. Default: all. The value must be textual.
